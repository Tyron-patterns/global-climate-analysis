ðŸ”µ5.A) COMPARE GLOBAL TEMPERATURE STATISTICS WITH AND WITHOUT IQR OUTLIER FILTERING (USING INLINE SUBQUERIES)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
--These two queries calculate summary statistics (min, max, avg, stddev) for both filtered and unfiltered datasets.
--The first uses inline subqueries to contrast results directly in one SELECT; the second leverages CTEs and CROSS JOIN for efficiency.
--Together they highlight how IQR filtering affects the global distribution and demonstrate two flexible SQL methods.

--This query isolates the country with the steepest warming trend since 1900 using linear regression.
--It groups average temperature by year, runs REGR_SLOPE, and sorts by the slope to find the top result.
