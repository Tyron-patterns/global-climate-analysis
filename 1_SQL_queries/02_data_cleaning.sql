ðŸ”´2.A) CHECK FOR MISSING VALUES (NULLs).
----------------------------------*/

	ðŸ”µ2.A.1) --checks for presence of missing values: compares how many null values and non-null values are present in key columns;
		-- uses COUNT(column) to assess overall completeness.

	select count(*) as total, 
		count(dt) as dt_notnull,
		count(averagetemp) as avg_notnull,
		count(averagetempuncertainty) as averagetemp_uncert_notnull,
		count(country) as country_notnull
	from global_t;

	ðŸ”µ2.A.2) --Identifies where missing temperature data occurs 
		--by grouping rows by country and year, filtering for NULL temperature fields.
		
	select country,    
		extract(year from dt) as year, 
		count(*) as missing_values 
	from global_t
	where averagetemp is null or averagetempuncertainty is null 
	group by country, year
	order by country, year

	**Results:**
	-- Lists amount of missing values per country/year
	-- Most countries have sparse missing data; at a first glance it seems like gaps are more common pre-1850
	-- with some countries that don't even have records in early years
		
	-- Let's invesigate this further!


	ðŸ”µ2.A.3) --This query calculates the percentage of missing values per country and identifies those exceeding a 5% threshold.
		--It joins a subquery counting nulls with a subquery counting total records per country, then filters with a HAVING clause.
		--This flags countries with potentially unreliable data that may affect the validity of further analysis.

	SELECT COUNT(*) AS countries_with_high_missing
	FROM (SELECT total.country,
        	COUNT(*) AS total_count,

    	GROUP BY total.country, nulls.null_count
    	HAVING ROUND(nulls.null_count::NUMERIC / COUNT(*)::NUMERIC * 100, 2) > 5) AS filtered_countries;

	**Results**
	-- 92 countries out of 243 total. 5% is not a negligible amount and 92 countries is a little under half of the total. 
	-- The next query investigates the concentration of missing data in early years: the data collection starts in 1943
	-- and measuring methods where more unrelaible at that time
		

	ðŸ”µ2.A.4) -- Calculates the number of NULL temperature values before 1850 vs. total per country using two subqueries 
		-- (null_temps_column_1850 and null_temp_total_column), then joins them on country to compare the results.  
		-- Computes the percentage of missing values for both timeframes and their difference using ROUND(...::numeric/count(...)...), 
		-- and finally groups everything by country to summarize the proportion of early missing data.

	**Results**:
