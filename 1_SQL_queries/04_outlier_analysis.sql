	游댯3.F.1)Z-score Global level

		游리3.F.1.i) checks if there are countries with temps outside 3xstddev (or |Z|>3)
		select country, 
		averagetemp,

		   	from global_land_temp_country)
		where abs((averagetemp - global_avg) / global_stddev) > 3
		order by z_score desc;


		游리3.F.1.ii) counting the number of outliers

		select country, 
		count(averagetemp)
		from (select country, 
		averagetemp,
		           (select avg(averagetemp) from global_land_temp_country) as global_avg,

		    	from global_land_temp_country)
		where (averagetemp - global_avg) / global_stddev not between -3 and 3
		group by country 
		order by country;


	游댯3.F.2)Z-score Country Level

		游리3.F.2.i) -- checks if outliers are present through WINDOW function
		select country, 
		averagetemp, 
		      	(SELECT country, 
		(averagetemp - AVG(averagetemp) OVER (PARTITION BY country)) /

		游리3.F.2.ii) counting the number of outliers for the consistency check for Cambodia
		select country, -- counting the number of outliers for the consistency check for Cambodia
		count(*) as temp_outliers 	
		from (SELECT country, 
		averagetemp, 
		(averagetemp - AVG(averagetemp) OVER (PARTITION BY country)) /

		FROM global_land_temp_country
		       	WHERE averagetemp IS NOT NULL)
		where z_score not between -3 and 3
		group by country  
		having country = 'Cambodia' 


		游리3.F.3.iii) counting the number of total records for Cambodia

		select country, 
		count(*), 
		z_score as total_temps 
		from (SELECT country, 
		averagetemp,

		游리3.F.3.iv) checks if outliers are present through WITH function

	游댯3.F.3) Z-score Country Level, different approach

		游리3.F.3.i) counting the number of outliers

		where (averagetemp - country_avg) / country_stddev not between -3 and 3
		group by per_country.country, country_avg, country_stddev


		游리3.F.3.ii) average of total records for countries presenting outliers

		select round(avg(temp_outliers)::numeric, 3)

					country_avg, 
					country_stddev, 
					ount(averagetemp) as temp_outliers

		where (averagetemp - country_avg) / country_stddev not between -3 and 3
		group by per_country.country, country_avg, country_stddev


		游리3.F.3.iii) using WITH to retrieve the average of total records for countries presenting outliers

		WITH temp_outlier_counts AS
		(select round(avg(temp_outliers),3),  
				country_avg, 
				country_stddev, 
				count(averagetemp) as temp_outliers
