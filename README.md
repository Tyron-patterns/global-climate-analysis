# global_climate-analysis
Full data analysis project on global temperature trends using SQL and Power BI.

# 🌍 Global Climate Trends Analysis

This project showcases my **data analysis skills and performances** using a real-world climate dataset. I explored, cleaned, and analyzed over 200 years of global temperature data using **SQL** and visualized key findings in **Power BI**. This analysis is part of my portfolio to demonstrate the technical and analytical abilities required for a junior data analyst role.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the structure and quality of the historical temperature dataset
- Clean the data by correcting types, handling null values, and removing duplicates
- Analyze global and country-level temperature trends over time
- Detect and interpret variability, outliers, and signs of climate instability
- Present insights visually using interactive dashboards

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **SQL (PostgreSQL)** — data exploration, cleaning, statistical analysis
- **Power BI** — data visualization, interactive charts, maps
- **Statistical Methods** — standard deviation, z-score, regression slope

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Average global temperature has risen steadily since the 1900s
- Several countries show significantly **higher warming trends**
- **Temperature variability** has increased — a potential sign of climate instability
- **Outliers** and **missing data** vary significantly across countries and years

---

## 💡 Why This Project?

I created this project to:
- Apply SQL and Power BI to a complex, real-world dataset
- Practice cleaning and interpreting messy time-series data
- Build a portfolio project that reflects **skills relevant to a data analyst job**
- Tell a compelling data story based on quantitative reasoning

## 📁 Dataset source

The dataset used in this project contains historical global temperature records by country, region, and date.

- **Original source**: Berkley Earth, via Kaggle
- **Dataset title**: Global Land Temperatures by Country
- **Link to download**: [Link to Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/unraveling-global-climate-change-through-tempera)
- **License**: Open data / public domain
  
The CSV file used in this repo is a direct copy of the original dataset, cleaned only for encoding and formatting (no rows or values altered).

This ensures full reproducibility of the analysis found in the SQL and Power BI sections.
