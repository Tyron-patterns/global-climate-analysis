# global_climate-analysis
Full data analysis project on global temperature trends using SQL and Power BI.

# 🌍 Global Climate Trends Analysis

This project showcases my **data analysis skills and performances** using a real-world climate dataset. I explored, cleaned, and analyzed over 200 years of global temperature data using **SQL** and visualized key findings in **Power BI**. This analysis is part of my portfolio to demonstrate the technical and analytical abilities required for a junior data analyst role.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the structure and quality of the historical temperature dataset
- Clean the data by correcting types, handling null values, and removing duplicates
- Analyze global and country-level temperature trends over time
- Detect and interpret variability, outliers, and signs of climate instability
- Present insights visually using interactive dashboards

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **SQL (PostgreSQL)** — data exploration, cleaning, statistical analysis
- **Power BI** — data visualization, interactive charts, maps
- **Statistical Methods** — standard deviation, z-score, regression slope

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Average global temperature has risen steadily since the 1900s
- Several countries show significantly **higher warming trends**
- **Temperature variability** has increased — a potential sign of climate instability
- **Outliers** and **missing data** vary significantly across countries and years

## 💡 Why This Project?

I created this project to:
- Apply SQL and Power BI to a complex, real-world dataset
- Practice cleaning and interpreting messy time-series data
- Build a portfolio project that reflects **skills relevant to a data analyst job**
- Tell a compelling data story based on quantitative reasoning

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset comes from the
[Kaggle Global Land Temperatures by Country](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data) 
project by Berkeley Earth. It includes average monthly land temperatures for countries from the year 1743 onward.
